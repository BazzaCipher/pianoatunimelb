Welcome to the University of Pianos at Unimelb, the University of
Melbourne Piano Locator - your guide for finding every playable piano across campus!


Whether you're sneaking in a quick practice or just want to enjoy a spot of music
our interactive map shows all the pianos we know of, with a quick summary of what
makes each one unique. Built by students, for students (and anyone who loves a good piano break).
